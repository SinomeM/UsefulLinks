# README 

In this repository I plan to somehow keep track of all computer-related stuffs I found 
and will find useful. They should be organized in categories and sub-categories. 

# 1. Simplify Working in the Terminal 

## zsh
The Z shell is a very cool interactive shell / scripting language, similar 
(but in several way more advanced) to Bash. [link](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)

- Oh My Zsh existence is the main reason I use the Z shell 
[link](https://ohmyz.sh/)    
- Two nice plugins not included in Oh My Zsh 
[link1](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) 
[link2](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)    
- My current .zshrc, requires the two previous plugins and the package fortune 
[link](https://github.com/SinomeM/DotFilesEtc/blob/master/.zshrc)    

## Noevim 
Neovim is modern re-implementation of Vim. Among a lot of other things, it makes 
creating and using plugins much more easy than the original Vim. [link](https://neovim.io/)

## tmux 
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, if you are used to screen it is similar but more 
powerful. [link](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

- Getting started [link](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started)    
- Oh my tmux, a really cool tmux configuration, 
[link](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)    
- Nice little tmux cheat sheet [link](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/)    

# 2. R

## Books 
These books have a more general scope than the majority of the other materials.

- R for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham [link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)    
- Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham [link](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)    
- Efficient R programming, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace 
[link](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html)    
- R packages, by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan [link](https://r-pkgs.org/)     

## data.table 

## ggplot 
Since I tend to use data.table as data structure, ggplot is the tidyverse package I
now use the most.

## packages development 

## tidyverse 

# 3. Python 

# 4. conda
